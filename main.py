""" Main.py

This is the main entry-point when the docker-container is initialized.
It executes the following steps:

1) read the input.txt
    This should contain the name of the method that should be executed.
    Optionally it contains some args and kwargs
2) In case it is a master algorithm the token is read from token.txt
    This is a JWT token that can be used to interact with the server
3) The method is executed
4) The output it written to output.txt

If the docker container is terminated. Output.txt will be send to the 
server by the node.
